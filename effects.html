			Global warming has already affected our everyday lives massively. As a result of global warming, the climate of the earth itself is changing. The average temperature all around the world is increasing each year. Global warming is also causing the extinction of some animals. The population of polar bears have decreased to about 20,000-30,000. Their habitat has been destroyed due to global warming. The rise of temperature caused the melting of the glaciers ad the ice. These are the polar bear’s shelter. 
			The extinction of animals has been one of the most impacted topics of global warming. The climate of Earth itself would soon approach a state where it is uninhabitable for humans.
